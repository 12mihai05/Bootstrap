# Bootstrap Repository (University Work)

This repository hosts a variety of web development projects completed as part of my university coursework. Each project demonstrates the application of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript in creating responsive and visually appealing web interfaces suitable for both educational and professional use.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

## Example: Bootstrap Spotify Page Clone

This example from the homework assignments is a static, one-page application designed to demonstrate the skills acquired in building responsive and visually appealing web pages using Bootstrap. It accurately replicates various elements of a Spotify page, including the layout, navigation bar, and footer.

## Features

- All projects implement responsive web design principles, implemented with Bootstrap grid system.
- Bootstrap's framework is utilized extensively for grid layouts, component styling, and interface consistency across projects.
- Mimics the design and layout of online pages or layouts shown at class.

## Usage

To view the Bootstrap Spotify Page Clone, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Explore the different sections, navigation links, and design elements presented in the clone. Please note that this is a static representation with no active functionality, so the search bar and other buttons do not perform any actions.
